## Problem Statement 2: Model Training and Versioning using a Simple Dataset

This repository is a part of my MLOps practice exercises. The objective of this project is to build, tune, and version basic machine learning models using a simple dataset.

### Tasks
- Load and prepare the dataset.
- Train a basic machine learning model.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Compare model performances.
- Save different model versions separately.

#### Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset (from sklearn.datasets).
- Features include:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
  - Iris flower class (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

#### Model Versions
- `model_v1.pkl`: Basic trained model.
- `model_v2.pkl`: Tuned model after hyperparameter optimization.
